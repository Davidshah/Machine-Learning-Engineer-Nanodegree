Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",

    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",

The AdaBoost model had a better average F<sub>1</sub> Score, but its training time was worse by a factor of 14. The K-Nearest Neighbors model had a faster training time, expected since its a lazy learner, but its average F<sub>1</sub> Score was lower. The SVM Model does a good job of balancing both performance and cost. However, it is worth noting that the SVM model's training time also grew the fastest between training test sizes. This is worth keeping an eye on to make sure it still scales with our objective."
